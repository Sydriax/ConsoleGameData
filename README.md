Inside this folder is all of my data and the scripts of how I scraped this data.

If you want data for any of the following games, it's available inside the imgs folder:
 - Atari 2600
 - Atari 5200
 - Commodore 64
 - Nintendo Entertainment System
 - Sega Master System

If you want images from any other console, it just requires running the scripts in the folder in the right order with the right inputs. The scripts aren't exactly self-explanatory, so if you'd like to know how to actually use them email me at benjaminfspector@gmail.com. If more than a few people ask me, I'll writeup the instructions and make it all nice.
